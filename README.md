Objective: Workshop Interactive Elements for Simulating a Network Controls

______

This code / model was developed for the Water Environment Federation - Collection Systems and Stormwater Conference 2024.  This concept was to create a real-world hydrologic and hydraulic network with some adverse hydraulic conditions (flooding, surcharging, combined sewer overflows).  The attendees of the workshop are to be guided to propose and leverage available assets within the hydraulic network by use of real
time controls.

This scope of this code is to run the model as well as be a space where new control logic can be developed to operate the various controllable facilities.
